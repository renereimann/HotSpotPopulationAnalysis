# Hot Spot Population Analysis (HSPA)
This projects contains scripts to run a hotpot population analysis. By this statistical method it is tested if a population of small p-values exists in a set of p-value results which are non significant on their own.  As a use case we implement the test for p-values testing neutrino fluxes from different directions in the sky.
